This is a simple To-Do application built with React.js. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js and npm: You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). npm is included with Node.js.

- Git: You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**: First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```

Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository>` with the name of the GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd <repository>
```

Replace `<repository>` with the name of the directory that was created when you cloned the repository.

3. **Install the dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the development server**:

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the development server. You can view the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
